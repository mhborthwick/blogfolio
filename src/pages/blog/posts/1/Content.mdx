Hello, and welcome to my blogfolio!

My name is Mike Borthwick, and I'm a software engineer based in Portland, OR.

For now, my plan is to use this space to share side-projects and write about software engineering (and possibly other subjects down the line).

I'll probably write up a longer post in the future to share more details about the architecture of this site, but in the meantime, you can check out the <a href="
https://github.com/mhborthwick/blogfolio" target="_blank">repo here!</a>

Till next time!

Mike
