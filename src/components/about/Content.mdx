With over 7 years of experience in the tech industry, I have a proven track record of success. Starting as a Customer Support Advisor at <a href="https://squarespace.com" target="_blank">Squarespace</a>, I gradually advanced to the role of Software Engineer in test.

Currently, I work to enhance and maintain Squarespace's test automation and infrastructure and lead QA efforts for the Payments team.
